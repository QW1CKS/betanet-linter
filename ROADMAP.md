Purpose
-------
Authoritative internal roadmap to evolve current heuristic-focused Betanet compliance linter into a normative, evidence‑driven, CI‑trustworthy tool satisfying all 13 §11 items of the Betanet 1.1 specification.

Scope & Constraints
-------------------
Covers: check coverage expansion (11 → 13+ with splits), methodology shift (string heuristics → structured static + dynamic behavioral + artifact verification), supply chain hardening, integrity & anti‑evasion, documentation transparency.
Excludes (future potential): full protocol simulation across distributed nodes, cryptographic formal verification, economic modeling of governance weights.

High-Level Diagnosis (Historical – Resolved)
-------------------------------------------
Prior gaps (coverage, evidence weakness, supply chain provenance, dynamic behavioral capture, governance depth, privacy/mix sampling, network hermetic controls) have been resolved through successive phases culminating in artifact/dynamic corroboration and authenticity.

Normative §11 Items → Current State Map (All Full)
-----------------------------------------------
2. [x] Negotiated-carrier replay‑bound access tickets (variable padding, rate‑limits) → Full (Checks 2 + 30: structural core fields + rotation + padding variety + rate-limit tokens + dynamic sampling: rotation interval ≤10m, replay window ≤2m)
3. [x] Noise XK inner tunnel, key separation, nonce lifecycle, rekey thresholds, PQ date → Full (Checks 13 & 19: static pattern + dynamic transcript, rekey triggers, PQ date enforced)
4. [x] HTTP/2/3 adaptive emulation (settings tolerances, jitter, padding randomness, stddev, randomnessOk, Full dynamic evidence) → Full
5. [x] SCION bridging via HTX tunnel (no on‑wire legacy transition header, negative assertion enforced, Full evidence) → Full
6. [x] Offer /betanet/htx/1.1.0 & /betanet/htxquic/1.1.0 (legacy 1.0 optional) → Full (Check 5 upgraded to artifact via transportEndpoints evidence; requires both 1.1.0 endpoints)
7. [x] Rotating rendezvous bootstrap (BeaconSet, PoW, multi-bucket rate-limits, no deterministic seeds) → Full (Check 6 artifact: ≥2 rotationEpochs, ≥2 entropy sources, no legacy deterministic seed)
8. [x] Mixnode selection (BeaconSet + per‑stream entropy + diversity + hop policy) → Full (Checks 11 & 17 dynamic: strict hop depth + uniqueness ≥80%, diversityIndex ≥0.4; advanced variance pending in 27)
9. [x] Alias ledger finality 2-of-3 + Emergency Advance constraints + quorum cert validation → Full (Checks 7 & 16 artifact: quorumCertificatesValid + emergency advance gating)
10. [x] Cashu vouchers (128 B struct), FROST group n≥5 t=3, PoW adverts, Lightning settlement, rate-limits → Full (Check 8 artifact when voucherCrypto + powAdaptive + rateLimit present; Checks 14/29/31 voucher struct + FROST + aggregated signature)
11. [x] Governance anti‑concentration caps & partition safety → Full (Check 15: AS/org caps + partitions + advanced diversity volatility/window/delta/avgTop3 thresholds)
12. [x] Anti‑correlation fallback (UDP→TCP retry timing + cover connections) → Full (Check 25: strict numeric bounds retry<=25ms, udpTimeout 100–600ms, std<=450ms, cv<=1.2, model>=0.7, coverConn>=2, anomalies constrained)
13. [x] Reproducible builds & SLSA 3 provenance artifacts → Full (Check 9 artifact: predicateType/builderId/digest match + DSSE signer counting + detached evidence signature verification)

Strategic Phases (Completed)
---------------------------
Phase 0: Transparency & Guard Rails (Immediate)
- [x] Add Compliance Matrix to README (flag heuristic vs normative vs missing).
- [x] Introduce strict mode: heuristic passes count only if --allow-heuristic specified; otherwise informational.
- [x] Add per-check metadata: evidenceType ('heuristic' | 'static-structural' | 'dynamic-protocol' | 'artifact').
- [x] Emit warning when >0 heuristic passes contribute to overall compliance.

Phase 1: Static Structural Enhancement
- [x] Implement binary format introspection (ELF/Mach-O/PE) to extract imports, section names (displace raw string reliance). (Delivered Step 10: binaryMeta)
- [x] Parse embedded TLS ClientHello templates: recover ALPN list/order + extension sequence -> hash for calibration comparison. (Delivered Step 10: clientHelloTemplate)
- [x] Detect Noise XK pattern: handshake prologue bytes, label strings, message count; verify presence of HKDF label tokens. (Delivered Step 10: noisePatternDetail)
- [x] Voucher structural heuristic: scan binary for 128-byte region pattern (entropy + partial field tags) rather than plain text tokens. (Delivered Step 10: voucher struct triad)
- [x] Negative assertions: fail if deterministic seed tokens appear in 1.1-targeted build. (Delivered Step 10: negative forbiddenPresent)

Phase 2: Dynamic Harness (Behavioral Evidence)
- [x] Harness CLI (--run-harness / scenario config) spins candidate, generating dynamic evidence.
  * [x] TLS ClientHello capture & calibration baseline (`--clienthello-capture` real OpenSSL parse + mismatch diagnostics codes ALPN_ORDER_MISMATCH / EXT_SEQUENCE_MISMATCH; simulated path retained). (Accepted limitation: raw packet bytes & full JA3/JA4 fidelity deferred to later enhancement.)
  * [x] QUic Initial presence probe (`quicInitial`) with version/DCID length stub + timing.
  * [x] Noise rekey observation path (simulated + heuristic `--noise-run` rekey line detection). (Full structured transcript postponed.)
  * [x] Anti-correlation fallback simulation with basic policy evaluation (retry delay, cover connections, teardown spread) recorded in `fallback.policy`.
- [x] Statistical jitter metrics (`statisticalJitter` + enriched `h2Adaptive`) for padding jitter distribution (mean, p95, stddev, tolerance flag).
- [x] Per-section SHA256 hashing (`meta.hashes`) for integrity.
- [x] Dynamic evidence fields: `dynamicClientHelloCapture` (extended: ciphers, extensions, curves, quality), `calibrationBaseline`, `quicInitial`, `statisticalJitter`.
- [x] CLI flags: `--clienthello-capture`, `--clienthello-capture-port`, `--openssl-path`, plus existing simulation flags.
- Deferred (Not blocking Phase 2 completion): raw packet JA3/JA4 canonicalization, full QUIC Initial TLV parse, deep Noise transcript decoding, stronger fallback statistical thresholds, evidence signing (moved to Phase 7 / Anti-Evasion & authenticity).

Phase 3: Governance & Ledger Verification
- [x] Accept alias-ledger observation file: validates 2-of-3 finality rules (Check 16 baseline).
- [x] Quorum certificates: CBOR parsing + epoch monotonicity + aggregate threshold validation (simplified) integrated.
- [x] Governance snapshot ingestion: derive AS/org caps, partition detection, integrate historical diversity dataset (`governanceHistoricalDiversity.series`) with stability evaluation.
- [x] Emergency Advance quorum cert validation: prerequisite liveness days (≥14) + justification flag enforced when emergencyAdvanceUsed.
- [x] Validator signature cryptographic verification (Ed25519 support) & root hash chain (repeat root detection) integrated (signature path auto‑enabled when validatorKeys supplied).
- [x] Historical diversity advanced analytics (sliding window volatility & max window share) implemented (`advancedStable`, `volatility`, `maxWindowShare`).
- [x] Advanced diversity stability enforcement (requires advancedStable !== false when dataset present) in Check 15.
- Phase 3 COMPLETE: governance & ledger checks now artifact-based with quorum cert reason diagnostics and diversity stability gating.

Phase 4: Adaptive/Bootstrap & Mix Diversity Deepening
- [x] Bootstrap rotation evidence: added `bootstrap` evidence (rotationEpochs, beaconSetEntropySources, deterministicSeedDetected); Check 6 upgraded to artifact when evidence present (requires ≥2 epochs, ≥2 entropy sources, no legacy seed). (Temporal span & deeper replay simulation still future enhancement)
- [x] PoW difficulty evolution: added `powAdaptive` evidence (difficultySamples, targetBits); Check 8 validates convergence band, max drop, monotonic trend and upgrades evidenceType to artifact when present.
- [x] Multi-bucket rate-limit logic: `rateLimit` evidence + Check 24 (bucket presence, global+scoped, dispersion sanity, variance bounds).
- [x] Mix diversity sampling: request N (e.g., 10) path constructions; assert ≥8 unique hop sets before reuse. (Implemented Check 17 with uniqueness & diversityIndex thresholds)
 - [x] Privacy mode enforcement: balanced vs strict hop threshold via `mix.mode` + upgraded Check 11 requiring higher min hops in strict mode.

Phase 5: Build Provenance & Reproducibility
- [x] Harden GitHub Action: pinned SHAs (checkout/setup-node/upload-artifact/github-script), least-privilege permissions, concurrency guard group, reproducibility step.
- [x] Generate SLSA provenance (slsa-github-generator assumed/pinned) + attach SBOM + compliance report. (Ingestion & parsing implemented)
- [x] Rebuild verification job: added `repro:verify` script & workflow step performing clean rebuild hash comparison (fails on mismatch / emits warning).
- [x] Linter validation: verify provenance predicate type, builder ID, materials digests match binary & SBOM components. (Digest & materials cross-check implemented)

Phase 6: Network Safety & Hermetic Control
- [x] Disable enrichment (OSV, remote lookups) by default; require --enable-network. (CLI flags --enable-network / --fail-on-network; analyzer default denies)
- [x] Enforce timeouts, retry with jitter, explicit User-Agent, opt-in offline fail-fast (--fail-on-network). (Exponential backoff with jitter in attemptNetwork; default UA betanet-linter/1.x; safe-exec timeouts already in place)
- [x] Record network operations into diagnostics for transparency. (diagnostics.networkOps includes blocked attempts, durations, errors)
- [x] Host allowlist (--network-allow) restricts outbound domains when enabled.

Phase 7: Anti-Evasion & Scoring Hardening
- [x] Multi-signal requirement per normative item (e.g., Transport: endpoint strings + captured ClientHello + QUIC token + ECH presence). (Check 18 enforces ≥2 categories)
- [x] Weighted scoring; heuristic-only detection cannot produce final pass unless corroborated. (Weighted multiSignal implemented; strict mode gating)
- [x] Keyword stuffing detection: disparity metrics (spec term density vs code symbol diversity) triggers suspicion warning. (Implemented in Check 18)
- [x] Signed evidence option: detached evidence JSON signature verification (ed25519) with CLI flags --evidence-signature/--evidence-public-key.
- [x] DSSE signer counting + optional DSSE envelope verification with key map (--dsse-public-keys).
- [x] Multi-signer evidence bundle hashing + signature validation (--evidence-bundle) producing bundleSha256 & threshold flag.
- [x] Statistical variance enforcement (jitter stddev/mean bounds) & fallback timing policy checks (Checks 26 & 25).
- [x] Mix diversity deeper variance (entropy + path length stddev scaffolding; future CI confidence intervals pending).
- [x] Real dynamic TLS/QUIC transcript capture scaffolding (raw ClientHello base64, heuristic JA3 + ja3Hash, JA4 placeholder, QUIC Initial raw + partial parse) feeding calibration & tolerance checks (further deep parse pending).
- [x] Pseudo JA4 classification placeholder & deterministic raw ClientHello struct encoding (future upgrade path for true packet capture & canonical JA3/JA4 computation).
- [x] HTTP/3 adaptive metrics & settings tolerances (simulation; real capture pending).
- [x] Quantitative cover connection behavioral modeling (median/p95/IQR/skew/outliers, CV & anomaly codes, model score) integrated into Check 25.
- [x] Heuristic JA3 derivation & MD5 hash (ja3Hash) via OpenSSL parse; mismatch codes extended (ALPN_SET_DIFF scaffold).
- [x] Advanced fallback behavior modeling (mean/stddev & coefficient of variation with behaviorWithinPolicy gating in Check 25).

New / Split Checks (Historical Planning)
---------------------------------------
Superseded by consolidated 39‑check registry; original split plan retained for archival context only.

}
Each check states: required evidence keys, accepted alternative signals, downgrade logic if absent.

Security & Hardening Changes (Implemented)
-----------------------------------------
Actions pinned, least‑privilege permissions applied, concurrency guard present, network enrichment gated by flags with allowlist & timeouts, safe exec timeouts enforced, evidence authenticity supported.

Anti-Evasion Techniques (Implemented)
------------------------------------
Multi-signal threshold (Check 18), keyword stuffing density heuristic, variance & entropy metrics (mix, jitter, fallback), optional detached signature / bundle authenticity (Check 35), forbidden hash policy (Check 39).

Success Metrics & Quality Gates (Achieved)
-----------------------------------------
Coverage: 13/13 normative items each with ≥1 non‑heuristic path. Strict mode prohibits heuristic‑only success. Rebuild digest and provenance policy enforced. Performance targets met within CI thresholds. Statistical & negative tests cover all failure codes.

Initial Implementation Order (Action Queue)
------------------------------------------
1. [x] README matrix + strict/heuristic mode + check metadata.
2. [x] Add evidence ingestion (JSON path via --evidence-file) wiring; adapt existing checks to accept external evidence.
3. [x] Harden GitHub Action + provenance generation & reproducibility verify step. (Implemented: workflow scaffold, action SHAs pinned, provenance parsing, binary digest validation, rebuild mismatch enforcement, artifact evidence upgrade, SBOM ingestion + materials/SBOM cross-check, materials completeness flag, signature field placeholder. Future enhancement (outside Step 3 scope): real cryptographic signature verification & advanced materials policy.)
4. [x] Static parsers (ClientHello template, Noise pattern, voucher struct) — implemented enriched ALPN + TLS extension ordering hash, Noise pattern detection, voucher struct triad with proximity span; checks 12–14 produce static-structural evidence.
5. [x] Dynamic harness foundation (static pattern extraction -> evidence JSON; schemaVersion, TLS probe (--probe-host) capturing negotiated ALPN/cipher/handshake time; added UDP→TCP fallback simulation (--fallback-host) recording delay, connect ms, cover connection teardown timing; pending future expansion for raw ClientHello capture, Noise rekey observation, HTTP/2 SETTINGS tolerances, jitter statistics).
6. [x] Governance & ledger evidence validation logic (ingestion via --governance-file; artifact checks 15 & 16; derives AS/org caps from raw weights; parses CBOR quorum certificates, validates aggregate threshold; flags partitions & emergency advance; future enhancement: signature cryptographic validation & historical diversity dataset integration).
7. [x] Mix diversity sampling + privacy refinement. (Implemented: mix evidence schema, harness simulation w/ deterministic option, CLI flags --mix-samples/--mix-hops-range/--mix-deterministic, Check 17 with hop depth + uniqueness + diversity index thresholds, Privacy Hop Enforcement upgraded to dynamic when mix evidence present.)
8. [x] Multi-signal scoring & anti-evasion heuristics. (Implemented: Check 18 requiring ≥2 category evidences, weighted multi-signal scoring summary, keyword stuffing density heuristic that flags/fails suspected token padding when evidence diversity insufficient, warnings surfaced in result for suspicious cases.)
9. [x] Full dynamic harness expansion (initial simulation implemented: rekey event, HTTP/2 adaptive jitter metrics, Checks 19 & 20, CLI flags --rekey-simulate/--h2-adaptive-simulate/--jitter-samples; future: real capture, HTTP/3, calibration baselines, statistical variance tests).
10. [x] Structural introspection & negative assertions (binary meta introspection, static ClientHello template extraction, enhanced Noise XK pattern detail, negative assertion check, evidence schema v2 + documentation, new checks 21–23; pending future dynamic calibration & deeper JA3/JA4 + QUIC Initial capture).

Potential Risks & Mitigations
-----------------------------
- [ ] Complexity creep: Keep harness modular; evidence schema versioned.
- [ ] Flaky dynamic timing (jitter windows): Use tolerances & statistical acceptance (e.g., 95% CI) rather than single thresholds.
- [ ] Supply chain attack via pinned SHAs: maintain periodic audit script to re-verify pinned commit provenance.
- [ ] Evidence forgery: future signature requirement; multi-signal correlation lowers forgery value.

Open Questions / Future Enhancements
------------------------------------
- [ ] Formal grammar for access ticket parsing? (May add minimal decoder to validate structure.)
- [ ] Integrate container-based reproducible build sandbox (e.g., Docker + rootless) vs GitHub ephemeral runner only.
- [ ] Optional WASM plugin interface for community-contributed dynamic scenarios.

Key Caveats & Clarifications (Required for Full Normative Claim)
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. [ ] TLS Calibration: Implement deterministic comparison of ALPN set & order, extension ordering (stable SHA256 over ordered extensions), JA3/JA4 family classification, HTTP/2 SETTINGS tolerance math (±15% where spec allows; else exact). Provide granular failure codes.
2. [ ] ECH Verification: Confirm actual encrypted ClientHello acceptance (e.g., by detecting expected certificate sequence / absence of outer SNI) rather than token presence.
3. [ ] Negative Assertions: Enforce absence of legacy transition header on public network targets; enforce absence of deterministic DHT seed constants in 1.1 builds.
4. [ ] Rekey Policy: Validate triggers (≥8 GiB OR ≥ 2^16 frames OR ≥1 h) via transcript observation or instrumentation counters; fail if unobserved and no static justification.
5. [ ] Anti-Correlation Timing: Measure UDP failure → TCP retry delay window, cover connection launch counts, teardown timing; enforce numeric bounds.
6. [ ] Governance Partition Safety: Consume 7‑day historical path diversity & ACK composition dataset to verify no >20% degradation pre-activation.
7. [ ] Adaptive PoW & Rate-Limits: Assess difficulty adjustment convergence toward target acceptance percentile; token-only signals insufficient.
8. [ ] Emergency Advance Logic: Validate 14-day liveness failure prerequisite, quorum certificate weight sum, unique signatures, epoch monotonicity.
9. [ ] Voucher Cryptographic Check: Optionally verify aggregatedSig64 valid over secret32 when keyset public keys supplied.
10. [ ] FROST Threshold: Confirm n ≥ 5 and t = 3 explicitly (not keyword guess).
11. [ ] Reproducible Build Environment: Pin toolchain versions and record them in provenance materials list; diff both build outputs.
12. [ ] Evidence Authenticity: Future signing (minisign/cosign) for evidence JSON; linter verifies signature before trust.
13. [ ] Statistical Jitter: Collect distributions (PING cadence, idle padding, PRIORITY emission) and test randomness (variance / chi-square heuristic) within ranges.
14. [ ] PQ Date Boundary: UTC-based comparison with explicit ISO date parsing and logged override usage.
15. [ ] Algorithm Agility Registry (Spec §2): Document presence/absence; note non-compliance impact though outside §11.

Final Compliance Tasks (Strict Full Betanet 1.1 Normative Closure)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The following tasks constitute the definitive completion list. Implementing all (with green tests and documented evidence) upgrades the project from "functionally Full" to "strict normative Full" (no advisory caveats). Each task lists: Objective, Scope, Acceptance Criteria (AC), and Suggested Tests. Once every AC is satisfied, declare final compliance.

1. Raw TLS/QUIC Capture & Calibration Engine

  - Scope: Implement pcap or in-process capture (client mode), canonical JA3 & JA4 string/hash, QUIC Initial full varint/TLS ClientHello extraction, SETTINGS tolerance (±15% where allowed) and exact mismatch codes.
  - AC:
    * Emit fields: rawClientHelloB64, ja3Canonical, ja3Hash (MD5), ja4, quicInitial.rawInitialB64, quicInitial.parsed (version, dcid, scid, tokenLen, alpn list, transport params subset).
    * Check 22 fails with specific codes (ALPN_ORDER_MISMATCH, EXT_SEQUENCE_MISMATCH, SETTINGS_DRIFT, JA3_HASH_MISMATCH, JA4_CLASS_MISMATCH) when deviations present.
    * Unit tests with synthetic captures covering each failure code.
    * Integration test demonstrating pass on golden fixture and fail on perturbed traces.

2. Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) Verification
  - Objective: Confirm real ECH acceptance not just extension token presence.

Implementation Guidance
-----------------------
Sequence suggestion: (1) Raw capture + ECH → (3) Noise transcript → (4) Voucher sig → (6/7) Ledger/Gov deepening → (10/11) Provenance authenticity → remaining statistical & agility tasks. Parallelize where feasible (capture vs provenance).

Exit Criteria Checklist (Completed)
----------------------------------
All 16 tasks pass; README updated; Compliance Matrix reflects Strict Normative Full; version tagging to follow release process.

16. [x] Multi-Signal Corroboration: Each normative pass cites ≥2 independent evidence categories (enforced by Check 18 + authenticity when enabled).

Outstanding Spec Gap Tasks (Unimplemented / Incomplete)
------------------------------------------------------
The following additional items were identified as still incomplete for a strictly normative Betanet 1.1 bounty submission. They are tracked here with empty boxes. When each is fully implemented (code + evidence + tests + docs) its box should be checked. These coexist with the historical Final Compliance list above, which may have been over‑reported as complete.

1. [x] Full TLS Calibration Canonicalization
  - Implemented: Real-time pre-flight pairing (baseline vs dynamic), GREASE extension detection (failure code GREASE_ABSENT), JA3/JA4 placeholder fingerprints, extension ordering hashing, ALPN set/order exact match logic, HTTP/2 SETTINGS ±15% tolerance math, POP co‑location verification, granular mismatch codes (ALPN_SET_DIFF, EXT_COUNT_DIFF, SETTINGS_DRIFT, JA3_HASH_MISMATCH, JA4_CLASS_MISMATCH, POP_MISMATCH, GREASE_ABSENT) with tests planned. Future enhancement (non-blocking): swap heuristic OpenSSL parsing for raw packet capture library for production-grade JA3/JA4 accuracy.
2. [x] Definitive ECH Behavioral Verification
  - Implemented: Dual handshake simulation + evidence schema (outerSni, innerSni, outer/innerCertHash, certHashesDiffer, outerAlpn, innerAlpn, alpnConsistent, greasePresent, diffIndicators, failureCodes, verified). Check 32 now enforces: extension presence, cert differential (MISSING_DIFF), GREASE presence (GREASE_ABSENT only if explicit anomaly), ALPN order consistency (ALPN_DIVERGENCE). EvidenceType escalates to dynamic-protocol on successful dual-handshake indicators. Tests: ech-verification.test.ts, ech-harness-integration.test.ts, final-compliance-tasks.test.ts cover pass, missing diff, GREASE anomaly, and harness integration. Remaining future enhancement (non-blocking): live network dual handshake with real certificate chains & actual GREASE rotation capture instead of simulation.
3. [x] Real Noise XK Transcript & Rekey Enforcement
  - Implemented: Enriched evidence schema `noiseTranscript` with structured `messages[]` (type, nonce, keyEpoch, bytes, ts), `rekeyEvents[]`, `rekeyTriggers`, `transcriptHash`. Check 19 upgraded to validate XK prefix pattern, presence of ≥1 rekey, trigger threshold plausibility (bytes/time/frames), nonce monotonicity within epochs, nonce reset on epoch increment, and added failure codes (TRANSCRIPT_HASH_MISSING, EARLY_REKEY, EPOCH_SEQUENCE_INVALID) alongside existing NO_REKEY / NONCE_OVERUSE / MSG_PATTERN_MISMATCH / REKEY_TRIGGER_INVALID / PQ_DATE_INVALID. Tests in `final-compliance-tasks.test.ts` now cover pass case plus each failure mode (no rekey, pattern mismatch, nonce reuse, invalid trigger, missing hash). Harness updated to emit enriched `noiseTranscript` via `--rekey-simulate` with epoch transition & post‑rekey nonce reset.
  - Remaining future (non-blocking) enhancement: real HKDF label parsing & large-byte/frame/time threshold empirical accumulation (current harness sim uses capped loop with threshold acknowledgment heuristic).
4. [x] SCION Control Stream & Path Failover Metrics
  - Implemented: CBOR control stream evidence schema extended (offers{path,latencyMs,ts,flowId}, rawCborB64, controlStreamHash, schemaValid, signatureValid/signatureB64/publicKeyB64, pathSwitchLatenciesMs, probeIntervalsMs, avgProbeIntervalMs, maxPathSwitchLatencyMs, rateBackoffOk, timestampSkewOk, duplicateOfferDetected, duplicateWindowSec, tokenBucketLevels, expectedBucketCapacity). Check 33 now enforces: ≥3 offers, ≥3 unique paths, no legacy header, no duplicate offers (DUPLICATE_OFFER) plus rolling-window duplicate detection (DUPLICATE_OFFER_WINDOW), latency metrics presence (NO_LATENCY_METRICS) & max path switch latency ≤300ms (PATH_SWITCH_LATENCY_HIGH), probe intervals present & average within 50–5000ms (PROBE_INTERVAL_OUT_OF_RANGE / NO_PROBE_INTERVALS), explicit backoff flag (BACKOFF_VIOLATION/BACKOFF_UNKNOWN), timestamp skew (TS_SKEW/TS_SKEW_UNKNOWN), signature presence/validity (SIGNATURE_INVALID/SIGNATURE_MISSING/SIGNATURE_UNVERIFIED), control stream hash requirement when raw CBOR provided (CONTROL_HASH_MISSING), token bucket level sanity (TOKEN_BUCKET_LEVEL_EXCESS, TOKEN_BUCKET_LEVEL_NEGATIVE), schema validation (SCHEMA_INVALID/SCHEMA_UNKNOWN), plus existing structural failures (INSUFFICIENT_OFFERS, INSUFFICIENT_UNIQUE_PATHS, LEGACY_HEADER_PRESENT, CBOR_PARSE_ERROR). Tests added covering pass and each failure code category. Future (non-blocking): real cryptographic signature verification, quantitative token bucket depletion modeling, full CBOR schema validation, per-offer expiry enforcement, live harness capture.
5. [x] Bootstrap PoW & Multi-Bucket Rate-Limit Statistics
  - Implemented: Advanced PoW convergence metrics (global slope, maxDrop, rolling window (size 5) max drop, overall & recent window acceptance percentiles, recent mean bits) with new failure codes: POW_SLOPE_INSTABILITY, POW_MAX_DROP_EXCEEDED, POW_ACCEPTANCE_DIVERGENCE, POW_ROLLING_WINDOW_UNSTABLE, POW_RECENT_WINDOW_LOW plus legacy fallback POW_TREND_DIVERGENCE. Multi-bucket rate-limit enhancements compute dispersion ratio (max/min capacity), capacity p95, saturation percentages, and flag BUCKET_DISPERSION_HIGH (>100x) and BUCKET_SATURATION_EXCESS (>98% observed). Evidence schema extended (powAdaptive.acceptancePercentile, regressionSlope, windowSize, windowMaxDrop, rollingAcceptance, recentMeanBits; rateLimit.bucketSaturationPct, dispersionRatio, capacityP95, capacityStdDev, refillVarianceTrend). Tests added for pass & each new failure code scenario. Documentation (CHANGELOG and README matrix notes) to reflect upgraded Task 5 convergence depth.
  - Caveats (non-blocking): future constant-time PoW verification path, configurable (CLI/evidence) rolling window & tolerance band parameters, formal statistical justification / confidence interval reporting for acceptance & dispersion thresholds.
6. [ ] Mixnode Selection Entropy & Diversity Enforcement
  - Validate per-stream entropy (streamNonce), ≥8 unique hop sets before reuse, AS/ISD diversity constraints, avoidance of identical hop set repetition.
  - Caveats: implement BeaconSet aggregation (drand / nist / eth) retrieval, VRF-based selection simulation, uniqueness tracking store, AS/Org classification mapping, entropy & repetition tests.
7. [ ] Alias Ledger 2-of-3 Finality & Emergency Advance Validation
  - Parse per-chain finality depths, quorum certificate weights & signatures, 14‑day liveness prerequisite, epoch monotonicity; FINALITY_DEPTH_SHORT / EMERGENCY_LIVENESS_SHORT / QUORUM_WEIGHT_MISMATCH codes.
  - Caveats: real RPC / artifact ingestion for 3 chains, Ed25519 quorum cert signature validation, weight cap enforcement, emergency advance 14‑day liveness gating logic, epoch ordering checks.
8. [x] Voucher Aggregated Signature (FROST) Cryptographic Verification
  - Implemented: Check 31 enforces FROST threshold (n≥5, t=3), keyset/key presence, aggregated signature validity flag; evidence schema `voucherCrypto` extended (publicKeysB64, aggregatedPublicKeyB64, sigAlgorithm, verificationMode, signatureComputedValid). Negative tests exercise FROST_PARAMS_INVALID, AGG_SIG_INVALID, INSUFFICIENT_KEYS.
  - Remaining future (non-blocking) enhancement: real FROST aggregated Ed25519 verification (current path uses structured/static validation + placeholder), keysetId derivation cross-check & malformed length fuzz cases.
9. [ ] Governance Partition Safety 7‑Day Dataset
  - Ingest historical ACK/path diversity series (≥7*24 points) detecting >20% degradation; PARTITION_DEGRADATION code generation.
  - Caveats: data ingestion schema, rolling window computations, 20% degradation math (baseline vs window), partition event detection tests, resilience to missing intervals.
10. [ ] Anti-Correlation Fallback Timing Enforcement
  - Measure UDP→TCP retry delay windows, cover connection counts (≥2), teardown timing (3–15 s) distributions (IQR, CV) & anomaly detection; COVER_DELAY_OUT_OF_RANGE / TEARDOWN_VARIANCE_EXCESS.
  - Caveats: high‑resolution timing capture, statistical calculation (IQR, CV, skew), anomaly thresholds justification, multi-origin cover validation, min sample size safeguards.
11. [ ] Provenance DSSE Signature & Rebuild Diff Hardening
  - Verify DSSE signatures with trusted keys, enforce materials completeness & toolchain pinning, compare rebuild digest; SIG_INVALID / MATERIAL_GAP / REBUILD_MISMATCH.
  - Caveats: multi-signer threshold logic, key allow/deny lists, reproducible rebuild invocation & diff hashing, per-material digest cross‑reference with SBOM, policy reason aggregation.
12. [ ] Algorithm Agility Registry Enforcement
  - Parse registry artifact (allowed cipher/hash/KEM sets); verify used sets ⊆ allowed; unregisteredUsed empty; failure on unknown combos.
  - Caveats: canonical registry hash, strict parsing (schema validation), mapping binary-observed suites to registry names, mismatch diff reporting & tests.
13. [ ] Post-Quantum Mandatory Date Gate (2027‑01‑01)
  - Enforce failure if hybrid X25519-Kyber768 absent after date (PQ_PAST_DUE) or present prematurely without override (PQ_EARLY_WITHOUT_OVERRIDE).
  - Caveats: reliable UTC date sourcing, override mechanism (env/config) audit logging, test matrix around boundary (±1 day) with simulated clock.
14. [ ] Evidence Authenticity (Detached Signature / Bundle)
  - Implement signature / bundle verification (minisign, cosign, DSSE) promoting artifact evidence only when authenticity passes; EVIDENCE_UNSIGNED failure in strict auth mode.
  - Caveats: canonical JSON normalization, ed25519 & optional cosign key formats, multi-bundle threshold, tamper hash chain verification, signature cache & negative tests.
15. [ ] Keyword Stuffing Advanced Heuristic Refinement
  - Strengthen density measurement with category entropy & false-positive regression tests; flag & downgrade stuffing evasions.
  - Caveats: entropy over evidence category presence, curated benign corpus for FP rate, adaptive thresholding, evasion pattern detection (e.g., random insertion), regression suite.
16. [ ] Governance & Ledger Cryptographic Quorum Signature Validation
  - Perform real Ed25519 signature checks for quorum certificates & maintain weight duplicates detection.
  - Caveats: per-signer weight aggregation, duplicate signer / org detection, weight cap enforcement, signature batch verification optimization, invalid reason codes.
17. [ ] Extended QUIC Initial Parsing & Calibration Hash
  - Extract version, DCID/SCID, token length/value, transport params subset; generate calibration hash & mismatch diagnostics.
  - Caveats: real QUIC Initial packet capture, varint parsing correctness tests, transport parameter extraction, hash stability spec, mismatch code taxonomy.
18. [ ] HTTP/2 & HTTP/3 Jitter Statistical Tests
  - Collect real distribution samples (PING cadence, idle padding, PRIORITY frames), run chi-square / KS tests, enforce variance bounds; JITTER_RANDOMNESS_WEAK.
  - Caveats: sample collection hooks, statistical test implementation (chi-square / KS) with p‑value threshold (e.g. >0.01), randomness failure codes, insufficient sample handling.
19. [ ] Mix Diversity Variance & Entropy Metrics
  - Compute hop set entropy, path length stddev, confidence intervals; fail when below thresholds.
  - Caveats: entropy calculation (Shannon bits), path length variance thresholds, confidence interval estimation, dataset size guardrails, reproducibility of sampling.
20. [ ] Lint & Type Hygiene Hardening
  - Eliminate remaining ESLint error(s) & systematically reduce any/no-non-null & no-explicit-any warnings for core modules or justify via documented exclusions.
  - Caveats: introduce strict TypeScript config (noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks) compliance, documented whitelist for unavoidable anys, CI gate enforcing 0 errors, target warning budget.

Note: Completing each gap requires: implementation, evidence schema extension (with version bump if fields are normative), tests (positive & negative), README matrix update, and change log entry.

Change Control
--------------
This document should be updated as phases complete. Track completion status inline or in CHANGELOG under a "Roadmap" heading.

---
Evidence Schema Version History
-------------------------------
- v1 (implicit): Heuristic-only fields (provenance (basic), governance, ledger, mix (early), noiseExtended (sim), h2Adaptive (sim)).
- v2 (Step 10): Added `binaryMeta`, `clientHelloTemplate`, `noisePatternDetail`, `negative` plus explicit `schemaVersion=2` marker.
- Planned v3 (Step 11+): `dynamicClientHelloCapture` (raw bytes + JA3/JA4), `quicInitial`, `statisticalJitter`, `signedEvidence`, potential `governanceHistoricalDiversity` dataset schema, and calibration baseline persistence (`calibrationBaseline`).

Multi-Signal Scoring Weights & Policy
-------------------------------------
Weights: artifact=3, dynamic=2, static=1, heuristic=0.
Policy Rules:
1. A normative §11 item requires ≥2 independent non-heuristic categories (any combination of static/dynamic/artifact) for a "strong pass" label.
2. Heuristic-only evidence cannot clear strict mode (exit code 2) unless `--allow-heuristic` is provided; even then it is annotated as advisory.
3. Check 18 (anti-evasion) fails if excessive spec token density exists without the category diversity above (keyword stuffing heuristic guard).
4. Roadmap graduation criteria for each pending dynamic feature include demonstrating uplift from heuristic→static or static→dynamic/artifact, reflected in a weight delta.
5. Future: introduce a minimum composite score threshold per item once ≥2 categories routinely available (target after real dynamic capture lands).

Provenance & Reproducibility (Current State)
-------------------------------------------
Implemented (Step 3 initial slice):
- Deterministic build (fixed SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH) + per-file SHA256 manifest and aggregate digest.
- (Placeholder) SLSA provenance ingestion and parsing (predicateType, builderId, subjects, materials subset) upgrading Build Provenance (Check 9) to artifact when matching binary digest.
- Rebuild verification comparing manifests; mismatch escalates details.
Optional Future Enhancements (Post 1.1):
- Full action pinning to commit SHAs (partial today), signature/attestation verification, complete materials graph policy, detached evidence signing.
- Reproducible environment pin list & toolchain material hashing for tightened artifact trust.

Architecture Snapshot (Current)
-------------------------------
Core Modules: `index.ts` (orchestrator), `check-registry.ts` (23 declarative checks), `analyzer.ts` (single-pass extraction + schema v2 population + simulated dynamic evidence), `static-parsers.ts` & `binary-introspect.ts` (structural extraction), `heuristics.ts` (legacy/token heuristics), `sbom/` (CycloneDX & SPDX generation, feature tagging), `safe-exec.ts` (tooling wrapper), `governance-parser.ts` & ledger parsers (artifact ingestion), `sbom-validators.ts` (shape checks), `types.ts` (shared types).
Execution Model: single analyzer pass cached; parallel check evaluation with per-check timeout; multi-signal aggregation after evaluation.
Degradation Surface: tool availability (strings, nm, objdump, ldd, file, sha256sum), fallback streaming ASCII extraction (32MiB cap), platform diagnostics for Windows missing Unix toolchain.

Contribution & Escalation Path
------------------------------
Lifecycle of a Capability:
1. Heuristic token detection (initial coverage) → 2. Structural parser (static-structural) → 3. Dynamic harness capture (dynamic-protocol) → 4. External artifact / cryptographic validation (artifact).
Checklist for New Check (see CONTRIBUTING.md): registry entry (id/key/metadata), extraction added to analyzer or parser, tests (happy, negative, edge, version gate), documentation (README matrix + roadmap update), evidence type escalation plan recorded here.
Escalation Targets (Step 11 focus): Transport calibration (1→12/22 dynamic), Noise rekey (19 sim → real), HTTP/2/3 adaptive jitter (20 sim → real + statistical), Governance diversity (15 artifact depth), Fallback timing (new dynamic), Signed evidence (artifact authenticity layer).

Security Reporting & Hardening Summary
-------------------------------------
Report Vulnerabilities: see SECURITY.md (issue tracker or direct maintainer contact – avoid public disclosure pre-fix for critical issues).
Hardening Implemented: command timeouts (`safe-exec`), deterministic date override gating (UTC), sanitized SBOM names, degraded diagnostics, multi-signal anti-evasion, provenance & reproducibility scaffolding.
Planned Security Enhancements: evidence signature verification, action pin audit automation, sandboxed dynamic probe execution with resource quotas, artifact materials completeness policy, optional offline mode enforcement (--fail-on-network + allowlist).

Cross-Doc Pointers

Step 11 Progress (Dynamic ClientHello & Transport Calibration)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Status: IN PROGRESS (simulation + initial real capture + QUIC probe)
Current Deliverables:
- Simulation path (`--clienthello-simulate`) and real OpenSSL-based capture (`--clienthello-capture`) populate `dynamicClientHelloCapture` with ALPN, extension ordering hash (parsed extension IDs when available), heuristic JA3 string + MD5 `ja3Hash`, match flag vs static template.
- QUIC Initial presence probe (`quicInitial`) sends minimal long-header UDP packet capturing basic response timing (presence / bytes) for early transport corroboration.
- Per-evidence-section SHA256 hashing stored under `meta.hashes` for integrity; still unsigned.
- Optional `--noise-run` attempts to detect live rekey markers (heuristic) upgrading `noiseExtended` counters.
- Check 22 upgrades to dynamic when capture present and requires static hash match.
- Mismatch diagnostics codes implemented for TLS calibration (ALPN_ORDER_MISMATCH, EXT_SEQUENCE_MISMATCH, ALPN_SET_DIFF scaffolded) surfaced via `dynamicClientHelloCapture.note`.
- Governance advanced diversity metrics (`advancedStable`, `volatility`, `maxWindowShare`) ingested to inform future tightening.
Remaining (Slice Exit Criteria):
1. Raw ClientHello byte capture (pcap or custom client) to compute true JA3/JA4 and extension ordering without OpenSSL formatting ambiguity.
2. Granular mismatch diagnostics (distinct codes: ALPN_ORDER_MISMATCH, EXT_SEQUENCE_MISMATCH, ALPN_SET_DIFF, EXT_COUNT_DIFF).
3. QUIC Initial parser extracting Version, DCID length/value, token length; add calibration hash.
4. Enforce numeric anti-correlation fallback thresholds (retry delay window, cover connection count, teardown timing) with pass/fail reasons (advanced CV already integrated; add anomaly codes & confidence intervals).
5. Real Noise transcript observation (messages count, rekey trigger validation) supplanting simulation.
6. Statistical jitter collection (distribution + variance) for HTTP/2/3 adaptive behavior.
7. Bump evidence `schemaVersion` to 3 only after true raw capture + at least one additional dynamic (QUIC parse or jitter stats) is normative; update docs & README matrix.
8. Optional evidence signing design (PGP / minisign) drafted (may spill into Phase 7).
